Ke6 because it forces Kh8
1. Ke6 - Kh8
2. f6 - gxf6
3. Kf7 (traps the king but pawn escapes) - f5
4. g7+ - Kh7
5. g8Q+ - Kh6
6. Qg6#

f5 turns it into a draw. Because:
1. f5 - g6
2. fxg6 - Ke6
3. g7 - Kf7
4. Ke4 - Kxg7
5. Kf4 - Kg8
6. g5 - Kg7
7. Kf5 - Kg8
8. g6 - Kg7
9. Kg5 - Kg8
10. Kf6 - Kh8

This results in a locked draw state.    

Winning move here is Ke4 because it supports both the pawn before proceding towards promotion.

1. f5 Ke7   
2. Ke5 Kf7
3. g5 Ke7
4. h5 g6  
5. hxg6 hxg6
6. f6+     
     
In this ending white can win by advancing any one of the pawns.

1. g4 a5 (Usually advisable to move the pawn that is free from opposition)
2. a4 Kf6
3. h4 Ke6
4. g5 Kf7
5. Kf5 Kg7
6. h5 Kf7
7. Ke5   (push King to left side to win black pawn)     

This locks the king on top for a while even when king is traversing to the left side of the board.
